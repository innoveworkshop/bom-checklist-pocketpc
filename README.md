A PocketPC companion application to the [desktop version](https://github.com/innoveworkshop/bom-checklist) of the program. This is intended to get an XML file exported from the desktop and work in the palm of your hand like a regular printed list.

This tool was created to make our life easier at [Innove Workshop](http://innoveworkshop.com/).
